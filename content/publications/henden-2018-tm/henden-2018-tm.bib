 abstract = {Identification of genomic regions that are identical by descent
(IBD) has proven useful for human genetic studies where analyses
have led to the discovery of familial relatedness and
fine-mapping of disease critical regions. Unfortunately however,
IBD analyses have been underutilized in analysis of other
organisms, including human pathogens. This is in part due to the
lack of statistical methodologies for non-diploid genomes in
addition to the added complexity of multiclonal infections. As
such, we have developed an IBD methodology, called isoRelate, for
analysis of haploid recombining microorganisms in the presence of
multiclonal infections. Using the inferred IBD status at genomic
locations, we have also developed a novel statistic for
identifying loci under positive selection and propose relatedness
networks as a means of exploring shared haplotypes within
populations. We evaluate the performance of our methodologies for
detecting IBD and selection, including comparisons with existing
tools, then perform an exploratory analysis of whole genome
sequencing data from a global Plasmodium falciparum dataset of
more than 2500 genomes. This analysis identifies Southeast Asia
as having many highly related isolates, possibly as a result of
both reduced transmission from intensified control efforts and
population bottlenecks following the emergence of antimalarial
drug resistance. Many signals of selection are also identified,
most of which overlap genes that are known to be associated with
drug resistance, in addition to two novel signals observed in
multiple countries that have yet to be explored in detail.
Additionally, we investigate relatedness networks over the
selected loci and determine that one of these sweeps has spread
between continents while the other has arisen independently in
different countries. IBD analysis of microorganisms using
isoRelate can be used for exploring population structure,
positive selection and haplotype distributions, and will be a
valuable tool for monitoring disease control and elimination
efforts of many diseases.},
