 abstract = {Bioconductor is a widely used R-based platform for genomics, but
its host of complex genomic data structures places a cognitive
burden on the user. For most tasks, the GRanges object would
suffice, but there are gaps in the API that prevent its general
use. By recognizing that the GRanges class follows ``tidy'' data
principles, we create a grammar of genomic data transformation,
defining verbs for performing actions on and between genomic
interval data and providing a way of performing common data
analysis tasks through a coherent interface to existing
Bioconductor infrastructure. We implement this grammar as a
Bioconductor/R package called plyranges.},
