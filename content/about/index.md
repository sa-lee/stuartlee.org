title: "Who?"
---

Hi, I'm Stuart! I'm a post-doctoral research fellow at Monash University in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics. My research focuses on 
human centred approaches to data science -- how can we 
use computation and visualisation to augment the exploration of data and models? How do we perform inference with exploratory visualisations? 
I am a big believer in using [interactive](https://github.com/vegawidget/virgo) and [dynamic](https://github.com/ggobi/tourr) graphics to achieve these goals.

I am also interested the process and "science" of doing data science - how can
we experiment with black box models and algorithms to understand how they work? What makes an effective data analysis? When can we say we've learned something new and true about the world from an analysis?

I want to make data science more accessible to people
without quantitative or programming backgrounds, which has led me to think
a lot about software design and teaching statistics and R.

Outside of research I enjoy:

* Coffee :coffee: both the making and drinking of.
* Cooking.  
* Board Games, especially co-op ones.
* Hiking.
