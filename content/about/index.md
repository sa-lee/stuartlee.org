title: "Who?"

Hi, I'm Stuart! I'm a PhD candidate in statistics at Monash University. I
like human centred approaches to data science, that is, how can we 
use computation and visualisation to help people learn from their models
and data (especially when the data is high dimensional and the models are 
complex). I'm also interested in making data science more accessible to people
without quantitative or programming backgrounds, which has led me to think
a lot about software design and teaching statistics and R.

Outside of work I like:

* Coffee :coffee:, maybe a bit too much.
* Cooking.  
* Board Games, especially co-op ones.
* Hiking.
