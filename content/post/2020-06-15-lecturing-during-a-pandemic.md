For the last twelve weeks I have been lecturing an [introductory data analysis
course](mida.numbat.space) for Monash's Masters of Business Analytics program. 
The before times format for the course is what has been dubbed 'lectorial'style, 
which is a ~~fancy~~ ugly  way of saying the classroom is flipped: students work
through lab based exercises while the lecturer and teaching assistants roam
through the class guiding the students through any issues. Occasionally
the class stops while the lecturer explains some tricky concept or reveals
a solution to the class. This semester we managed to do one traditional
lectorial during which a unversity wide email was sent detailing that live
action classes were to be cancelled until further notice.
