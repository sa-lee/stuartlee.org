<p>I recently attended the <a href="http://bioc2019.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor 2019</a> conference in New York City, where
I was lucky enough to give a workshop on my Bioconductor package
<a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/plyranges.html"><code>plyranges</code></a>
and present some <a href="https://github.com/sa-lee/superintronic">new ideas</a> I’m working
on. After some discussion with
both Bioconductor veterans and new-comers there was general agreement that it
was hard to find good resources or even a beginner’s guide for learning
S4. This blog-post is an attempt to rectify that.</p>
<div id="what-is-s4" class="section level2">
<h2>What is S4?</h2>
<p>S4 is a formal object oriented system in R, it’s named S4 since it was a part
of version four of S language. It’s implemented in the
<code>methods</code> package created by John Chambers and maintained by the R core team.
It also is one of several packages that ships with base R and is loaded on
start up.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-use-s4" class="section level2">
<h2>Why use S4?</h2>
<p>Compared to other object oriented paradigms in R, S4 requires a developer
to write classes that follow a strict structure - an S4 object has its
components defined upfront using slots. A well designed class can avoid code
duplication, and the strictness helps a developer to ensure
their code is correct. As will we see later, defining an S4 class requires components and their types to be declared upfront, meaning that S4 classes
are also self-documenting.</p>
<p>As with any other programming language or pardigm,
you may have to use S4 because everyone else is using it. Take the
Bioconductor project for example. They have defined standard S4 classes in their
ecosystem to represent many types of ‘omics’ data. Developers are strongly
nudged use these classes and their associated methods. This has two massive
benefits: firstly, a developer doesn’t need to invent their own class and
secondly, it enables interoperability between many different packages.</p>
<p>Learning to program with S4 can be daunting - especially for new users of R
or those who are used to the relative simplicity of the tidyverse ecosystem.
I remember being incredibly confused and overwhelmed when I started to learn
it (a lot of the documentation and guides are extremely technical) and found
myself reading a lot of other people’s code in order to figure out what on
earth is going on. From both a developer and user perspective, I think
the essence of S4 can be distilled into three principles.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>The design of an S4 class is merely a way of setting up an abstraction for a data
analysis problem. This is often the hardest part of using S4, coming up with a
‘good-enough’ abstraction for the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Let’s try creating an S4 class for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle</a>.
A turtle can move in a path in two dimensions as illustrated below:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-02-s4-a-short-guide-for-perplexed_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.gif" /><!-- --></p>
<p>We can define a class to represent a Turtle as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(methods)
setClass(&quot;Turtle&quot;, 
         slots = c(location = &quot;numeric&quot;, orientation = &quot;numeric&quot;, path = &quot;matrix&quot;)
)</code></pre>
<p>At a minimum an S4 class needs two things the name of the class
and a named character vector of slots. Slots define the data that forms
the class. In the case of the Turtle, we have three slots one representing
the turtle’s current location as a numeric vector, one representing
it’s current orientation (the angle that the turtle is facing), and finally
a matrix representing the path it’s travelled so far.</p>
<p>We can create an instance of a Turtle using <code>new</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lil_turtle &lt;- new(&quot;Turtle&quot;, 
                  location = c(0,0), 
                  orientation = 0,
                  path = matrix(c(0,0), ncol = 2))
lil_turtle</code></pre>
<pre><code>## An object of class &quot;Turtle&quot;
## Slot &quot;location&quot;:
## [1] 0 0
## 
## Slot &quot;orientation&quot;:
## [1] 0
## 
## Slot &quot;path&quot;:
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    0    0</code></pre>
<p>Slots can be accessed using <code>@</code> but we will see later it’s better to define
functions called getters that access each component of the object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lil_turtle@location</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0 0</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>lil_turtle@orientation</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0</code></pre>
<p>We would like to ensure that when we create a new turtle
that it’s current location is always a numeric vector of length 2, and that
it’s orientation is in degrees between -360 to 360. We’ll also
check that the path is a matrix with two columns. We can do this by creating
a function to check our turtle is valid:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>okTurtle &lt;- function(object) {
  # check location has length 2
  loc_ln &lt;- length(object@location)
  # check orientation is between -360 to 360 and has length one
  orientation &lt;- object@orientation
  # check path is a numeric matrix
  path &lt;- object@path
  c(if (loc_ln != 2) &quot;location must have length two.&quot;,
    if (length(orientation) != 1) &quot;orientation must have length one.&quot;,
    if (abs(orientation) &gt; 360) paste(&quot;orientation angle&quot;, orientation, &quot;must be between -360 and 360 degrees.&quot;),
    if (mode(path) != &quot;numeric&quot;) &quot;path must be a numeric matrix&quot;,
    if (ncol(path) != 2) &quot;path must have two columns&quot;
  )
  TRUE
}

setValidity(&quot;Turtle&quot;, okTurtle)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Class &quot;Turtle&quot; [in &quot;.GlobalEnv&quot;]
## 
## Slots:
##                                           
## Name:     location orientation        path
## Class:     numeric     numeric      matrix</code></pre>
<p>This updates the class definition, to include the checking a turtle is an OK
turtle.</p>
<p>Finally, we need an interface to creating a objects of class Turtle.
This is called a constructor. Generally, this is a function that calls <code>new</code> and has arguments corresponding to the slots of our object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Turtle &lt;- function(location = c(0,0), orientation = 0) {
  new(&quot;Turtle&quot;, 
      location = location, 
      orientation = orientation,
      path = matrix(location, ncol = 2))
}</code></pre>
<p>Calling <code>new</code> now that the validity is set, will check that the arguments
provided to the constructor result in a proper turtle. We haven’t included
an argument for the path, cause our Turtle hasn’t travelled anywhere yet…</p>
<p>Note that it’s a convention when using S4 to use CamelCase (I don’t make
the rules!).</p>
<p>So far we can’t do anything interesting with turtles, we need to define
some methods!</p>
</div>
<div id="principle-2-in-statistics-we-like-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Principle 2: in statistics we like functions</h3>
<p>Both S3 and S4 use generic functions which is a little different from
other object-oriented programming languages (it is a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism">ad-hoc polymorphism</a> if you like that
kind of thing). A generic function determines
how a method is called when an argument is a given class (or combination of classes).
In general, a generic function should be created if you plan to reuse it
for many distinct classes or if it will be useful to other package developers.</p>
<p>For example, we could create two generic functions that represent
a turtle moving forward and a turtle turning.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setGeneric(&quot;forward&quot;, 
           function(x, ...) standardGeneric(&quot;forward&quot;)
)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;forward&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This creates a function called <code>forward</code> with an argument <code>x</code>, called
the signature of the generic and <code>...</code> which can be other arguments that
will determine how a turtle moves. The class of <code>x</code> changes which <code>forward</code>
method will be selected.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can implement a generic for reorienting a turtle.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setGeneric(&quot;turn&quot;, function(x, ...) standardGeneric(&quot;turn&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;turn&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To complete our interface, we will also create generics for accessing
and replacing each slot of our class.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setGeneric(&quot;location&quot;, function(x) standardGeneric(&quot;location&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;location&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>setGeneric(&quot;location&lt;-&quot;, function(x, value) standardGeneric(&quot;location&lt;-&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;location&lt;-&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>setGeneric(&quot;orientation&quot;, function(x) standardGeneric(&quot;orientation&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;orientation&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>setGeneric(&quot;orientation&lt;-&quot;, function(x, value) standardGeneric(&quot;orientation&lt;-&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;orientation&lt;-&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>setGeneric(&quot;path&quot;, function(x) standardGeneric(&quot;path&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;path&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>setGeneric(&quot;path&lt;-&quot;, function(x, value) standardGeneric(&quot;path&lt;-&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;path&lt;-&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We now have a bunch of generics next we need to create methods for our turtle.
Let’s start simple with our getter functions. To create a method, we use
<code>setMethod</code> with
:
* the name of our generic
* an argument called ‘signature’, that tells us the class the generic will dispatch on
* a function that tells us what the method does</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setMethod(&quot;location&quot;, signature = &quot;Turtle&quot;, function(x) x@location)
setMethod(&quot;orientation&quot;, signature = &quot;Turtle&quot;, function(x) x@orientation)
setMethod(&quot;path&quot;, signature = &quot;Turtle&quot;, function(x) x@path )</code></pre>
<p>We can also create our replacement methods, these will update each slot.
A turtle’s orientation and path are always updated relative to where
they already are positioned.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setMethod(&quot;location&lt;-&quot;, signature = &quot;Turtle&quot;, function(x, value) {
  x@location &lt;- value
  stopifnot(validObject(x))
  x
})

setMethod(&quot;orientation&lt;-&quot;, signature = &quot;Turtle&quot;, function(x, value) {
  x@orientation &lt;- orientation(x) + value
  stopifnot(validObject(x))
  x
})

setMethod(&quot;path&lt;-&quot;, &quot;Turtle&quot;, function(x, value) {
  x@path &lt;- rbind(path(x), matrix(value, ncol = 2))
  stopifnot(validObject(x))
  x
})</code></pre>
<p>Now we can implement methods for forward and turn:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setMethod(&quot;forward&quot;, signature = &quot;Turtle&quot;,
          function(x, steps) {
            location &lt;- location(x)
            angle &lt;- orientation(x) * pi / 180
            x_dir &lt;- steps * cos(angle)
            y_dir &lt;- steps * sin(angle)
            
            new_location &lt;- c(location[1] + x_dir, 
                              location[2] + y_dir)
            
            location(x) &lt;- new_location
            path(x) &lt;- new_location
            
            x
          })

setMethod(&quot;turn&quot;, &quot;Turtle&quot;, function(x, angle) {
  orientation(x) &lt;- angle
  x
})</code></pre>
<p>Most of the time, you probably don’t need a new generic function but rather
to reuse an existing one (for Bioconductor packages generic functions are
contained in the <code>BiocGenerics</code> package) by setting a method for your class.
For example, maybe we want a prettier printing method for our turtle, for
S4 classes, the print method is called “show”:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setMethod(&quot;show&quot;, &quot;Turtle&quot;,
          function(object) {
            utf8::utf8_print(paste(&quot;\U1F422&quot;,
                                   paste(&quot;Located at:&quot;, paste(round(location(object), 1), collapse = &quot;,&quot;)),
                                   paste(&quot;Facing:&quot;, orientation(object), &quot;degrees&quot;),
                                   collapse = &quot;\n&quot;))
          })

lil_turtle</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;🐢​ Located at: 0,0 Facing: 0 degrees&quot;</code></pre>
<p>When designing a new class it’s a good idea to target methods for generic
functions that are in the base API. This ensures portability of your code and
means that your class behaves in a way that is already familiar to a user.</p>
<p>Now we have implemented enough methods to make our turtle move, we can start
getting our turtle to move around in 2-d! For example, we could move in
a triangle:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(magrittr)
turtle &lt;- Turtle()

turtle &lt;- turtle %&gt;% 
  turn(angle = 60) %&gt;% 
  forward(steps = 3) %&gt;%
  turn(angle = -120) %&gt;% 
  forward(steps = 3) %&gt;% 
  turn(angle = -120) %&gt;% 
  forward(steps = 3)

turtle </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;🐢​ Located at: 0,0 Facing: -180 degrees&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>path_taken &lt;- path(turtle)
plot(path_taken)
segments(path_taken[1:3,1], 
         path_taken[1:3,2], 
         path_taken[2:4, 1], 
         path_taken[2:4, 2])</code></pre>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>In R there is usually package for the task you would like to perform.
Similarly, when using S4 somebody has probably done the hard work of designing
a class related to an analysis or problem at hand. In Bioconductor, the
community has standardised core data structures related to all aspects of ‘omics’,
with two key examples being the <code>SummarizedExperiment</code> and <code>Ranges</code> classes.
Instead of inventing your own class
you can extend (or just use) other package’s data structures. If the class
has been implemented well, you won’t have to go through the boring process
of implementing an interface such as making setters and getters.</p>
<p>Let’s extend our Turtle class, to a Turtle that’s holding a pen. A turtle
holding a pen will include three new slots: colour, thickness, and an on/off switch.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setClass(&quot;TurtleWithPen&quot;, 
         slots = c(colour = &quot;character&quot;, thickness = &quot;numeric&quot;, on = &quot;logical&quot;),
         contains = &quot;Turtle&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The argument <code>contains = "Turtle"</code> tells <code>setClass</code> we are inheriting
from the <code>Turtle</code> class. A <code>TurtleWithPen</code> is still a <code>Turtle</code> but has
additional slots corresponding to a Pen. We can write a constructor
for a Turtle holding a pen:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>TurtleWithPen &lt;- function(x, colour = &quot;pink&quot;, thickness = 1, on = FALSE) {
  new(&quot;TurtleWithPen&quot;, colour = colour, thickness = thickness, on = on, x)
}

turtle &lt;- TurtleWithPen(Turtle())
turtle</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;🐢​ Located at: 0,0 Facing: 0 degrees&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>class(turtle)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;TurtleWithPen&quot;
## attr(,&quot;package&quot;)
## [1] &quot;.GlobalEnv&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Our <code>TurtleWithPen</code> inherits all the methods associated with Turtle, including
<code>show</code> which is why the displayed object looks the same. All the same moves
we made with an ordinary turtle can be made by one holding a pen:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>turtle %&gt;% 
  turn(angle = 60) %&gt;% 
  forward(steps = 3) %&gt;%
  turn(angle = -120) %&gt;% 
  forward(steps = 3) %&gt;% 
  turn(angle = -120) %&gt;% 
  forward(steps = 3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;🐢​ Located at: 0,0 Facing: -180 degrees&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now we want to modify the <code>show</code> method, if the pen is on,
then will animate the Turtle’s path, otherwise we will show the Turtle
has normal.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setMethod(&quot;show&quot;, &quot;TurtleWithPen&quot;, 
          function(object) {
            if (object@on) {
              path &lt;- path(object)
              colnames(path) &lt;- c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)
              path_tbl &lt;- data.frame(path, id = seq_len(nrow(path)))
              plot &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(data = path_tbl) + 
                ggplot2::geom_path(ggplot2::aes(x, y), 
                                   colour = object@colour, 
                                   size = object@thickness) +
                ggplot2::theme_void() + 
                gganimate::transition_reveal(id)
              gganimate::animate(plot)
            } else {
              callNextMethod()
            }
          })</code></pre>
<p>Now the show method will animate, if the pen is switched on, otherwise
we will call the regular Turtle method.</p>
<p>We can try this out by having our Turtle walk through an equilateral triangle:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pendown &lt;- function(x) {
  x@on &lt;- TRUE
  x
}
penup &lt;- function(x) {
  x@on &lt;- FALSE
  x
}

turtle &lt;- turtle %&gt;% 
  pendown() %&gt;% 
  turn(angle = 60) %&gt;% 
  forward(steps = 3) %&gt;%
  turn(angle = -120) %&gt;% 
  forward(steps = 3) %&gt;% 
  turn(angle = -120) %&gt;% 
  forward(steps = 3)


turtle %&gt;% 
  show()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-02-s4-a-short-guide-for-perplexed_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.gif" /><!-- --></p>
<p>But if we put the pen up, then we get the usual <code>show</code> method:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>turtle %&gt;% 
  penup() </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;🐢​ Located at: 0,0 Facing: -180 degrees&quot;</code></pre>

<p>This post has barely scratched the surface of what S4 can do. We haven’t
really touched on the ideas of multiple inheritance or multiple dispatch. Hopefully
though if you’re new to S4, the ideas behind it are a little less scary!</p>
<p>There are several resources for learning more about S4:</p>

<li><p>Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R book has a section on <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html">S4</a> (and <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s4.html">here</a>) and other types of object-oriented programming in R.</p></li>
